# Fork Simplification

## CURRENT

- **Objective:** Turn this fork into a substantially smaller, adapter-native
  framework centered on the latest App Router, Cache Components, Partial
  Prerendering, Partial Prefetching, and Turbopack.
- **Desired outcome:** One coherent product with fewer runtime modes, compiler
  paths, public options, dependencies, and expensive test combinations.
- **Current shape:** Branch `feedthejim/simplify-next-rendering` from
  `1f65c7646e`. `AGENTS.md` contains the product contract, architecture
  principles, supported-behavior map, and phased checklist. The first verified
  slice makes the rendering and navigation feature set unconditional.
  `fork-metrics.json` is the committed scorecard baseline.
- **Constraints:** Backward compatibility is out of scope. Do not add migration
  layers or special removed-feature errors. Preserve only behavior in the fork
  contract. Keep each independently verified slice committed before starting
  the next one. Regenerate `fork-metrics.json` and review its delta for every
  slice.
- **Product invariants:** App Router only, Cache Components always on, PPR as
  the rendering model, Partial Prefetching as the navigation model, Turbopack
  as the application compiler, and explicit platform adapter boundaries.
- **Next action:** Map and delete the non-Cache-Components and legacy PPR
  renderer branches.
- **Done Means:** Every `AGENTS.md` fork checklist item is completed or
  explicitly resolved out of scope; supported behaviors have proportionate
  tests; the core package builds; every slice records its simplification and
  performance metrics; each slice is committed; the worktree is clean; and no
  required follow-up is implicit.
- **Last verified:** 2026-07-27 on `feedthejim/simplify-next-rendering`.
  `pnpm --filter=next types`, 31 focused config tests, and
  `pnpm --filter=next build` passed.

## History

### 2026-07-27: Simplification scorecard

Added a reproducible metric snapshot covering source size, public configuration,
legacy mode references, dependencies, tests, built artifact size, and validation
timings. Every future slice updates the snapshot and reviews its delta.

### 2026-07-27: Rendering model configuration

Established the fork contract and made Cache Components, PPR, Partial
Prefetching, `use cache`, and cached navigation unconditional. Removed their
public configuration, environment opt-ins, migration errors, and the orphaned
hard-deprecation error type.
